## Introduction

This repository contains three applications developed to demonstrate the possibility of intent-hijacking in the modern Android System.

## Instructions

- Clone or Fork the repository
- Install all three apps on an AVD or physical device

### To run the demonstration:

- Run all three apps on the same device
- From app A, select "Send intent" and a Boolean value from the radial dial.
- Choose either app B or app C to recieve the intent.
- App B will respond with the same data in a desired manner
- App C will respond with the boolean value reverced to demonstrate that the intent intended for App B can be read and manipulated-
- App A will display intents sent and recieved.
